# Kafka Spring Boot Example

This repository is designed as a **practical learning project** for understanding [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) in combination with [Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/). Instead of covering Kafka concepts in isolation, each chapter focuses on a specific use case, progressively building on previous ones to provide a structured learning experience.

## **Goals of the project**
- Learn **Kafka's core features** step by step using real-world use cases.
- Use **Spring Boot** for the most convenient and modern Kafka integration.
- Keep each chapter self-contained, allowing independent exploration and testing.

## **Chapters**
1. **Event-Driven Communication** - Setting up a simple producer and consumer in Spring Boot.
2. **Reliable Messaging** - Handling errors and retries.
3. **Scaling Consumers** â€“ Understanding Partitions and Consumer Groups.

This repository is a work in progress. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
