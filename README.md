# Kafka Spring Boot Example

This repository is designed as a **practical learning project** for understanding **Apache Kafka** in combination with **Spring Boot**. Instead of covering Kafka concepts in isolation, each chapter focuses on a **specific use case**, progressively building on previous ones to provide a structured learning experience.

## **Goals of the project**
- Learn **Kafka's core features** step by step using real-world **use cases**.
- Use **Spring Boot** for the most convenient and modern Kafka integration.
- Keep **each chapter self-contained**, allowing independent exploration and testing.

This repository is a work in progress. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
